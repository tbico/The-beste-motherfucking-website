<title>The Best MotherFucking website</title>

<h1>This is the <em>Best</em> motherfucking website.

</h1> 
    
<p> Really, it is.
</p>
<h2>Seriously, you guys think that a fucking website doesn't need some styling?</h2>

<p>You probably build websites using vim and feeling hardcore. You think your 4.99KB <span class="hello"> motherfuckingwebsite</span> (.com) is going to get you some fucking award to put on your damn footer as a link. You think your fucking default font is gonna make your website run even on a toaster.
</p>
<p> <span class="salut">  WRONG</span>, motherfucker
</p>

<h2>The best kickass website</h2>
<p>Let me describe the <i>real</i> perfect-ass website which still has the glory of the past <span class="hello"> motherfuckingwebsite</span> :</p>

<ul>
<li>Shit doesn't weigh a ton (in fact it's just 34.97 KB when the 27.83KB cat picture below is removed)
</li>
<li>The page weighs exactly 63.02kB, 93.7% less than the <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google home page</a> 
</li>
<li>Fits on your iPhone 1st gen (although it doesn't work on your damn 16x32 Tamagotchi)
</li>
<li>Looks <i>almost</i> the same on every screen</li>
<li>Every asshole that visits this website can use it without any problem <small>well, kind of</small></li>

</ul>

<p> It uses some cool technologies like JavaScript <img src="java.svg" height="15px">, CSS 3 <img src="CSS3.svg" height="15px"> and HTML5 <img src="HTML5.svg" height="15px">
</p>

<ul><p> <span class ="WTF"> 0. You just DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO </span></p></ul>


<p>Yeah, a <span class="truc">#444 is cool </span> but a <span class="machin"> #454545 is better.</span>


</p>

<h2>Put some pictures</h2>
 <img src="cat.jpg" "A nice and cute cat" alt="white and gray cat looking at you, with his yellow and green eyes">
            <figcaption>A cat, just to keep the context of the website.</figcaption>
       

        <p>
            We're not looking at a novel by Stephanie Meyer, this is a 
            <span class="hello">motherfuckingwebsite</span>
             so include some pictures to give a context.
        </p>
        <p>The website shouldn't be overfilled with pictures, but it should make the user happy while reading your nonsense words.</p>
        <p>You see that fancy cat? He's happy, you should be too.</p>
